            <h1>About Rhythmz Radio</h1>
            <p>Rhythmz is a radio station that once was founded by Marlon or DJ Mar back in 2009. During this time, Marlon had envisioned having a radio station that has structure but can also be a safe environment for all. Marlon entrusted a few members that he knew he can trust in order to execute a successful run. However, that run evidently ended in 2011 when all the administrators went their own ways.</p>
            <p>
                Rhythmz is a radio station that was envisioned being more than just a radio but a community with many talents. Even though it fell apart in the beginning, the goal and the will of fire never died out. Therefore, in 2020, Marlon found 3 amazing and trustworthy companions that share the same ambition that Rhythmz envisioned and later reconstructed it. Rhythmz is now back in session and ready to feel the rhythm! Are you ready to hear our heartbeat!?</p>
